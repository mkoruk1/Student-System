# Student-System
Global AI Hub Python bootcamp project.

# Project

In the project, you will create a student grading system. What is required of you:
Choose a lesson for yourself. (Mathematics, Physics, Linear Algebra etc.) Create your grade range (100-80 ⇒ A, 79-70 ⇒ B etc.) Create a system where you can enter Student Information (Name, Surname, School Number, exam score) and keep this information. Based on the information entered, the student must show whether or not he has passed the course. If the student has passed the course, the text "Passed" should be shown in the field where the student's information is kept, and "Failed" if the student did not pass the course. Create a Dataframe that shows the students whose grades have been entered, who passed the course and those who did not. Convert the created Dataframe to an Excel table.
